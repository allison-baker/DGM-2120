      <h1>Posing</h1>
      <p>
        One of my biggest struggles when starting photography was how I should pose my models. It is difficult for me to
        come up with poses on the fly, and I felt like I would run out of ideas and then not know how to fill the rest
        of my sessions. Here are the best tips I've learned for creative and dynamic posing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Look for inspiration online before your shoot starts - I maintain Pinterest boards for all the different kinds
          of shoots I do, and before I meet with a client I go through my boards, refresh my memory, and screenshot my
          favorites.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incorporate movement into your poses - for example, have your couple plant kisses on each other while you take
          photos, or have your model swish their coat or walk towards the camera. There are endless movement poses, you
          are only limited by your creativity!
        </li>
        <li>
          Use your surroundings and props - sometimes clients will bring props to a shoot, and those can be very helpful
          in thinking of new poses. You should also be paying attention to your enviroment and using your surroundings
          for more poses. Is there a wall the client can lean on? A bench your couple can sit on?
        </li>
        <li>
          Learn from other photographers - I went to a collaborative shoot and was able to work with other photographers
          and watch how they pose their models, and it was very inspirational for me and my work. If this kind of
          opportunity is not available to you, make sure you're following and interacting with other photographers on
          social media and taking inspiration from their work! There is community in photography, we can all work
          together and learn from each other.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Lastly, the most important thing you can do to improve your posing is just to practice. Don't underestimate the
        value of time and experience when improving your skills.
