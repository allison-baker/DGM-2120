        So you've bought your first camera! First step is to figure out what kind it is. There are a few common types:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Polaroid - takes and prints little pictures right from camera. Great for social use among friends!</li>
        <li>Film - more difficult to use as it does require the tools to develop the film after shooting.</li>
        <li>
          Digital Point and Shoot - small, usually has zoom capabilities and can shoot video but you cannot change
          lenses and there is no manual mode.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hybrid - has a manual shooting mode and some settings but you cannot change lenses. This was my first camera!
        </li>
        <li>
          DLSR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) Camera - manual and many other modes, lenses are interchangeable, shoots
          video and photos. This is the kind of camera I have now and what I use for paid shoots.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The majority of photographers who shoot for clients shoot with a DSLR camera. Some photographers offer shoots in
        film and/or DSLR. If you have a polaroid, digital point and shoot, or hybrid camera, running a business might
        not be the right choice for you yet.
        <strong>That's not to say that these cameras can't take good pictures,</strong> or that you can't be creative
        with them, but you're much more limited in how you can edit the pictures from those kinds of cameras, and
        clients are not likely to pay for those photos. But practice with those and save for a DSLR or film camera! I
        had my hybrid camera that I bought at an estate sale for a year before I bought my first DSLR. I used it to
        learn how to shoot in manual and practice posing portraits with my friends. This was all essential practice for
        me before I ever starting charging for shoots.

        For the purposes of this tutorial, I will be discussing how to use a typical DSLR camera, because that's what I
        know how to shoot with. If you want to learn how to shoot film, I recommend you start with

        Before we get into the different shooting modes in your DSLR, let's talk about what goes into taking a
        well-exposed photo. First of all, exposure is the amount of light that reaches your camera's sensor. You can
        think of it as the brightness, although they are technically not the same. It's determined by the shutter speed,
        aperture, and ISO. Lets go over those three:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Shutter speed - how long your camera lens stays open to capture light. The faster your shutter speed, the
          faster your camera lens opens and closes and the less light reaches your sensor. For motion shots like in
          sports, having a fast shutter speed is good to get crisp photos. For night shots of the stars, long-exposure
          (long shutter speed) photos are better.
        </li>
        <li>
          Aperture - how wide your camera lens opens. The wider it opens, the more light it lets in to hit the sensor
          and the brighter your photo will be. To get the blurry background bokeh effect in portraiture, wide aperture
          (smaller number) is better. For your whole landscape photo to be in crisp focus, a narrower aperture (bigger
          number) is best.
        </li>
        <li>
          ISO - refers to the sensitivity of your camera's sensor. The lower the number, the less sensitive your sensor,
          and the darker your photos will be. For shooting in direct sunlight, have your camera on your lowest ISO. For
          shooting at night, have your camera on a higher ISO so that the sensor is more sensitive to any of the light
          around you. However, the higher your ISO, the grainier your photos will be.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That's a lot to remember and a lot to have to tweak and fiddle with on your own to get the perfectly exposed
        photo. Your camera's auto mode will do all of this for you, and use what the camera determines to be the right
        settings for the photo you're trying to take. This is a great place to start, however, it's usually better to
        have more control over your exposure and do it yourself. We'll take about how you can have that control in the
        next section.

          <p>
            There are many different brands that make DSLR cameras, but they all have the most popular shooting modes in
            common. The more expensive your camera is the more range you will have in your camera's sensors and you'll be
            able to do more with it, like take pictures in darker settings and with less grain.

        Each of the different shooting modes allows you different levels of control over the three aspects of exposure:
        shutter speed, aperture, and ISO. Let's go over these different shooting modes in more depth:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Auto - like we discussed earlier, auto allows you no control over any of these three aspects and chooses them
          for you. It's a great place to start, but to level up in your photography you need to be able to adjust your
          exposure yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
          Manual - manual allows you full control of all three aspects, so it's up to you to determine which combination
          of the three creates the right exposure. This can be daunting and take lots of practice, but don't be scared
          of manual mode - it's all I shoot in now.
        </li>
        <li>
          Aperture Priority - you have control over the aperture and ISO, and based on that, the camera chooses an
          appropriate shutter speed for you to get a properly exposed photo.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shutter Speed Priority - similar to aperture priority, except you have control over the shutter speed and ISO
          and the camera chooses the aperture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Programmed Auto - you have control over the ISO and the camera chooses aperture and shutter speed. This is the
          next step up from auto in learning how to control your camera's settings.
        </li>
      </ul>

        You can change your camera's current shooting mode with the little dial that is usually on the top of your
        camera body. Experiment with different shooting modes in different lighting until you get used to the controls
        and you can see what different combinations of exposure settings can do to affect your exposure. Experiment with
        leaving two exposure aspects the same and just change one to see what happens with your photo. These are all
        useful things to do when learning to shoot in full manual.
