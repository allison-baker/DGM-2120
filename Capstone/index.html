      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        Budget Vacations began in 2019 in Provo, UT. The founders of Budget Vacations met at Brigham Young University
        and decided to use their shared love of budget traveling to build a company that curates travel for others.
        Since then, we've helped families and individuals find their perfect getaways for cheap - like only broke
        college students can do!
      </p>

      <h2>Our Clients</h2>
      <p>
        We cater to any travel lover, but our main clientele are people just like us - individuals and families who just
        don't have the biggest budget. College students especially like to hire us because used to be right where they
        are, traveling as full time college students with very little money!
      </p>

            "I hired Budget Vacations to book my trip to Paris last summer and it was an easy, stress-free experience!
            They planned all my hotels and flights for me, and my friends were shocked when I told them the price for 10
            full days in Paris!" -Barbara

            "I planned my trip to Thailand with my family of 6 through Budget Vacations, and it was by far the easiest
            trip I've ever planned! Usually traveling with such a large family is expensive and stressful for me, but
            Budget Vacations handled it all with ease." -John

            "I wanted to travel to Brazil to visit my family but I didn't think I'd be able to afford it until I found
            Budget Vacations! They found such cheap flights and hotels for me that I was able to visit for 8 days for
            the first time since I went off to college in the States 4 years ago. I highly recommend them!" -Fabiona

            "I thought that Budget Vacations only did international trips, but they planned a really cheap and really
            fun trip for me around different US States I hadn't been to before. I loved planning my trip through them
            and I definitely will again!" -Ethan
